With multi-site, active-active replication, MinIO enables multiple independent deployments (locations, data centers, or regions) to operate as peers, synchronizing data in real time.

This architecture brings several decisive advantages for backup strategies:

Continuous availability / hot-hot access — writes can be accepted anywhere, without waiting for failover

Geographic redundancy — your data remains accessible even if an entire site fails

Consistent object state across sites — changes (uploads, deletes, metadata) replicate fully across all nodes

Scalable mesh replication — no hard limit on number of sites; each bucket can replicate across many deployments

In short: MinIO’s multi-site active-active design makes it an excellent foundation for robust, distributed backup systems — resilient, performant, and always on.

We had some in-depth discussions about external backup systems for the Redis database. MinIO was mentioned as a potential option, and with its active-active replication feature, it could be a viable solution.
