Thank you very much for walking us through the Ansible CD process for the inventory system. Your explanation made everything much clearer, and we now see that Redis would greatly benefit from following this approach for deployments using Ansible Tower, playbooks, and Ansible Vault.

We also truly appreciate the time and effort you put into sharing both the functional and technical vision of the DBE group.

Best regards,
